# Flapper-news-graphql-server
Initial learning for building a **GraphQL** server.

  based on the new standard query language, GraphQL. A client

  or update with post news. The server is GraphQL API Server
  to build using Node.js, ExpressJS, MongoDB, and GraphQL.

  GraphQL to develop the full stack of a JavaScript-based 
  application with new modern web technologies which are
